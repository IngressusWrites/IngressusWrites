![Ingressus Writes Banner (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120280671/209448596-cf97b057-b6c2-48af-ae2f-eb5f117c33a6.png)
Greetings. I am a Voltaris Master who Achillean forced to become a writer. I also started to try to learn how to code on the side. While I still don't understand redstone and probably never will (I'm looking at you, Fredrick) coding is acceptable.

This profile is where I publish projects I am doing to learn how to code. I am currently learning how to code on FreeCodeCamp.

God bless!

Banner: The surprised Ingressus is an emoji taken from the Knights of Ardonia Discord server. I created my banner from scratch.
