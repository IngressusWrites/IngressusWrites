Greetings. I am a Voltaris Master who Achillean forced to become a writer. The main thing that I do is write Songs of War fanfictions on Wattpad. Those covers in the banner are the covers of my fanfictions. Yep, that's about it

I also started to try to learn how to code. While I still don't understand redstone and probably never will (I'm looking at you, Fredrick) coding is acceptable. This profile is where I publish projects I am doing to learn how to code. I am currently learning how to code on FreeCodeCamp. That is, if Lucidius and Tygren do not continue to distract me...

I am learning to code on FreeCodeCamp. However, I don't have any projects outside of the ones on FreeCodeCamp yet.

Hmm...
Could you please donate Prime Songs? I have been looking for them ever since Thalleous hid them away.
