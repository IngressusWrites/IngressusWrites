Greetings. I am a Voltaris Master who Achillean forced to become a writer. The main thing that I do is write Songs of War fanfictions on Wattpad. Those covers in the banner are the covers of my fanfictions. Yep, that's about it

I also started to try to learn how to code on the side. While I still don't understand redstone and probably never will (I'm looking at you, Fredrick) coding is acceptable. This profile is where I publish projects I am doing to learn how to code. I am currently learning how to code on FreeCodeCamp. That is, if Lucidius and Tygren do not continue to distract me...
